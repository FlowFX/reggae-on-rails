# Reggae on Rails

This project is a rewrite of [reggae-cdmx.com](https://github.com/FlowFX/reggae-cdmx.com)
using Ruby on Rails instead of Python and Django. The reason for this can be found
[here](https://flowfx.de/blog/moving-back-to-germany/).

The current status is very much **under development**.
